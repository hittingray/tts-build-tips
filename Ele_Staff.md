## General Tips
- *Wash the Pain Away* is a very powerful heal for both you and the raid
- Switching out of Fire Attunement is a significant DPS loss
- *Burning Retreat* can be used as an additional evade in emergencies
- For best DPS, cast a *Lava Font* in between longer cooldown skills such as *Overload Fire* and *Meteor Shower*
- *Flame Burst* does more damage than auto-attacking
- As an Elementalist, you have the lowest survivability of any class, don't stray too far from the zerg or healer.
- Running Staff means you will not be able to contribute to break bars effectively. It is always better to continue DPS if possible rather than changing attunements to break
- Air 3 and 5 (cast with the edge of the field inside the boss hitbox) can be used to break if required, as well as Ice Bow 5 and Lightning Hammer 3 and 5

## Boss Tips

### Vale Guardian
- Consider changing to a Fresh Air build for this fight, or changing class entirely, as it can be very difficult to survive 
- If you are suicidal or insane and want to play an Staff Elementalist here, your best role will be in the circle group
- *Rebound* should be used for additional sustain and group heals
- During the first phase, get in for *Overload Fire* in between circles
- *Lightning Flash* provides excellent mobility for getting to circles quickly
- *Aftershock!* is good for seeker control. It has long range and very long cripple application. Just remember to use it BEFORE the seekers are in the circle
- Consider replacing *Glyph of Storms* with *Magnetic Shield* for additional sustain and mobility
- If you choose to run *Glyph of Storms*, use it in earth to apply blinds to seekers, neutralising them effectively for 10 seconds
- Other seeker control skills: Earth 4 and 5, Air 3, Water 4. Note all of these skills cause you to leave Fire Attunement, dropping your DPS
- *Meteor shower* is useless beyond phase 1 and the split phases, however in phase 1 cast it with as much of the AOE outside the arena. This will cause more meteors to fall in a much smaller area and increase DPS

### Gorseval the Multifarious
- Remember to slot the Fire Specialization 
- Try not to use *Burning Retreat* off the edge of the arena, as you'll most likely die
- You will most likely be required to control Orbs beyond phase 2. A *Lava Font* will get an Orb below 10%, but don't quite kill it. They can be cleared with an auto attack or *Flame Burst*
- Consider running Ice Bow as your 3rd utility skill. It does insane DPS to Gorseval and will be a DPS boost for any class that picks up the spare. 
- During the Rampage attack, you can drop a *Lava Font* on Gorseval, cast *Ice Bow*, use skills 5 (break) > 4 > 3, then change back to staff. Note if the break is slow you will take significant damage by doing this (still worth it)
- Start the fight in Air Attunement cast *Glyph of Storms* > *Overload Air* > *Fire Attunement* > *Lava Font* > *Meteor Shower* > *Lava Font* > *Overload Fire* > *Ice bow*. Continue to use *Overload Fire*, *Glyph of Storms*, *Meteor Shower* and *Ice Bow* off cooldown. 
- Don't cast any these skill back-to-back, always drop a *Lava Font* in between for best DPS
- Run *Rebound* over *Glyph of Elementals* as Elementals will draw aggro from spirits and *Rebound* provides additional sustain in the face of Gorseval's oppressive Ghostly Aura
- If you have members of the raid team that do not have their Dodge key bound, you can trait into *Gale Song* to reduce the DPS loss from getting hit by the Slam attack

### Sabetha the Saboteur 
- *Lightning Flash* is highly recommended here as it makes dodging Flame Walls a breeze and if you are on Cannon duty helps with getting to the launch pads quickly
- Despite Sabetha's small hitbox, *Meteor Shower* is still higher DPS than Auto Attacking
- Same is true for *Ice Bow* if you are super pro and don't need *Lightning Flash*
- Staff Elementalist is the best class for Cannon duty due to the insane speed that you can kill the cannons. 
- *Lava Font* > *Overload Fire*/*Glyph of Storms* > *Lava Font* is enough to kill a cannon. You can jump down before the cannon dies to get extra DPS on Sabetha
- Using *Burning Retreat* on a cannon platform will probably cause you to fall to your death
- If you are low on HPs or the raid needs a heal, you can change to Water Attunement before jumping down from a cannon platform. *Overload Water* will be ready to use almost as soon as you land
- Start the fight in Air so you can cast *Glyph of Storms* and *Overload Air* before changing to fire
- Try not to stand too close to Sabetha even when overloading fire, as you may find yourself with a Timed Bomb
- *Lava Font* can be used to clear off Karde's Flame Turrets
- Staff Elementalist can be used to kite flack, however you will be away from the healer and other group support. It is recommended to run *Rebound* if you do end up kiting flack
- If kiting flack, you can get in for an *Overload Fire* immediately after a flack shot (dodge towards Sabetha and start channeling immediately), and use - *Burning Retreat* to return to the edge of the platform

### Slothasor
- Don't play a Staff Elementalist at Slothasor. Change to a Fresh Air build
- Seriously, Staff Elementalist is a liability at Slothasor and adds nothing to the group
- Yes this has been tested and it's extremely bad, tab over to the Fresh Air build now

### Bandit Trio
- The first 2 bandits are all about DPS, just follow your rotation and put out as much DPS as you can
- For Narella, move to the cliff just above her and cast *Lava Font* and *Flame Burst* while throwing kegs as required
- For the 3rd utility, run *Feel the Burn* as the first Elementalist or *Ice Bow* beyond the first

### Matthias Gabrel
- Due to how much Matthias moves around, you may want to consider Fresh Air
- *Feel the Bum* can be used to easily clear icy patches during phase 1, and *Flame Burst* and clear multiple patches if they are close togeather
- *Gale Song* can be traited to get you out of a fiery tornado 
- *Lightning Flash* is very useful of getting to fountains quickly, or getting out of the corruption once you have dropped it at the edge of the arena
- *Armor of Earth* can be used if you are really stuggling with fiery tornados, just don't stand in them for too long or you'll probably die
- As this fight is more about surviving than DPS, don't be affraid to change out of Fire Attunement
- For breaks, cast Water 4, Air 3 and 5, Earth 5 and then auto attack with earth until the end of the break
- Water 5 can be used to clear conditions if needed

### Siege the Stronghold

### Keep Construct

### Xera
