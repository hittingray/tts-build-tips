I am using MarkdownPad 2 to convert Markdown to HTML. Please push all MD files and HTML to the `gh-pages` branch.

The way I am currently converting the Excel sheets to MD is copy-pasting it into an editor. If you look at one of the pages, it's quite self explanatory the formatting I am using, but:

```
# Build Name

[Build name](Hyperlink)

## General Tips
- List point 1
- List point 2

## Boss Tips

### Boss name
- List point 1
- List point 2
```
